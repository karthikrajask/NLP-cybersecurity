NCRP NLP Model for Cyber Crime Categorization

This project implements an NLP-based cyber crime categorization system powered by the NCRP Model (Natural Crime Recognition and Prediction).
The system can analyze textual crime reports, complaints, or queries and classify them into specific cyber crime categories such as Phishing, Online Fraud, Identity Theft, Cyberbullying, Data Breach, etc.

Additionally, the project includes a Streamlit-based chatbot interface, allowing users to interactively ask questions or input crime-related descriptions to receive real-time insights and category predictions.
